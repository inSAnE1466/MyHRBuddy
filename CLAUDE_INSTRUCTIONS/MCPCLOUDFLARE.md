# MCP Implementation PRD: Remote Integration with Cloudflare

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for ClickUp, Gmail, and Neon PostgreSQL with the MyHRBuddy application through Cloudflare's remote MCP capabilities. The goal is to leverage existing MCP servers rather than building custom implementations.

## Objectives

1. Enable AI-powered interactions with ClickUp for task management
2. Implement Gmail integration for email notifications and communications
3. Connect to Neon PostgreSQL for database operations
4. Deploy these integrations as remote MCP servers on Cloudflare
5. Integrate the MCP clients with the MyHRBuddy Next.js application

## Key Components

### 1. Remote MCP Servers

We will utilize existing MCP server implementations:

- **ClickUp MCP Server**: For task creation, updates, and management
- **Gmail MCP Server**: For email communications and notifications
- **Neon MCP Server**: For database queries and operations

### 2. Cloudflare Integration

Instead of running MCP servers locally, we will deploy them as remote servers on Cloudflare, making them accessible over the internet with proper authentication.

### 3. Client Integration

The MyHRBuddy Next.js application will connect to these remote MCP servers to enable AI-powered interactions.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration

1. **Install Required Dependencies**
   - Add necessary packages to package.json
   - Configure development environment

2. **Configure Cloudflare Workers**
   - Create Cloudflare account and configure Wrangler
   - Set up authentication for MCP servers

### Phase 2: Deploy Remote MCP Servers

1. **ClickUp MCP Server**
   - Deploy @taazkareem/clickup-mcp-server to Cloudflare
   - Configure with ClickUp API key
   - Set up OAuth for secure access

2. **Gmail MCP Server**
   - Deploy @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp to Cloudflare
   - Configure with Gmail API credentials
   - Set up OAuth for secure access

3. **Neon MCP Server**
   - Deploy neon-mcp-server to Cloudflare
   - Configure with Neon PostgreSQL connection string
   - Set up secure authentication

### Phase 3: Client Integration

1. **Create MCP Client Implementation**
   - Implement remote MCP client in the MyHRBuddy app
   - Set up authentication flow

2. **Update AI Service**
   - Modify ai-service.ts to use MCP clients
   - Implement natural language processing for MCP interactions

3. **Create UI Components**
   - Build chat interface for natural language interactions
   - Implement UI for visualizing MCP operations

## Technical Specifications

### Authentication

- OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- Token-based access for MCP servers
- Role-based access control for admin users

### API Integration

- ClickUp API for task management
- Gmail API for email communications
- Neon PostgreSQL connection for database operations

### Deployment

- Cloudflare Workers for remote MCP servers
- Vercel for Next.js application
- Environment variables for secure configuration

## Research Topics

The following topics require further research to complete this implementation:

1. **Cloudflare Workers MCP Deployment**
   - Proper syntax and configuration for remote MCP servers
   - Authentication flow for Cloudflare Workers
   - Wrangler commands for MCP server deployment

2. **MCP Remote Integration**
   - Protocol implementation for remote MCP servers
   - Client-server communication patterns
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Existing MCP Server Implementations**
   - Available options for ClickUp MCP servers
   - Gmail MCP server capabilities and limitations
   - Neon PostgreSQL MCP server options

4. **OAuth Implementation**
   - Secure authentication for remote MCP servers
   - Token management and refresh strategies
   - User authentication flow

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Response time optimization for MCP operations
   - Caching strategies for frequently used data
   - Connection pooling for database operations

## Key Questions

1. What are the exact Wrangler commands needed to deploy existing MCP servers to Cloudflare?
2. How do remote MCP servers handle authentication and authorization?
3. What transport layer is used for remote MCP communication?
4. How can we implement proper error handling for remote MCP operations?
5. What are the performance implications of remote vs. local MCP servers?
